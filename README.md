# wildfire-smoke-detector
An end-to-end ML project for wildfire smoke detection.

This project is connected to a repository on [DagsHub](https://dagshub.com/Rihab.Feki/wildfire-smoke-detector). 

**DagsHub** is a GitHub for Machine Learning projects. It eases MLOps practices by enabling data scientists and machine learning engineers to version their data, models, experiments, and code, through its integration with [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc) and [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html). 

## Run the project locally 

1. Clone the project: 
````shell 
git clone https://github.com/RihabFekii/
````

2. Set up a virtual python environment, by running the following commands:
